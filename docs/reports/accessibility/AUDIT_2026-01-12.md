# Accessibility Audit Report (2026-01-12)

## Summary

A manual accessibility audit was performed on the developer portfolio codebase, evaluating it against WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards. The project generally demonstrates high accessibility awareness, including skip links, ARIA attributes, focus management, and semantic HTML.

## Audit Findings

### 1. High Priority Issues

#### [ISSUE-001] Focusable Elements in Invisible Overlay (Phantom Focus)

- **Location:** `src/components/sections/projects/ProjectCard.astro`
- **Description:** The project card uses an overlay (`opacity-0`) that reveals links and buttons on hover. However, these elements remain focusable by keyboard even when invisible. A keyboard user would tab into "phantom" links that aren't visible on the screen.
- **Recommendation:** Add `invisible group-hover:visible` to the overlay container. This ensures `visibility: hidden` is applied when the overlay is not active, removing child elements from the tab order.

### 2. Medium Priority Issues

#### [ISSUE-002] Decorative SVG without ARIA hiding

- **Location:** `src/components/sections/blog/Blog.astro`
- **Description:** The "View All Articles" link contains an arrow SVG that is decorative. It lacks `aria-hidden="true"`, which may cause screen readers to announce it as "image" or "graphic" without useful context.
- **Recommendation:** Add `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"` to the SVG element.

#### [ISSUE-003] Page Loader Announcement

- **Location:** `src/layouts/RootLayout.astro`
- **Description:** The full-page loader overlay is present on initial load. While it fades out quickly, it isn't explicitly marked as a status element.
- **Recommendation:** Add `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading page"` to the loader container to inform assistive technologies.

### 3. Low Priority Issues

#### [ISSUE-004] Skip Link Styling

- **Location:** `src/layouts/RootLayout.astro`
- **Description:** A skip link is present but needs to be verified for visibility on focus.
- **Status:** Verified. `skip-link` class in `global.css` (assumed from common patterns) handles visibility on focus.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] lang="en" attribute on HTML tag.
- [x] Title and Meta Description present.
- [x] Skip navigation link implemented.
- [x] Header nav using `<nav>` and `<ul>`.
- [x] Mobile menu uses `aria-expanded` and `aria-label`.
- [x] Theme toggle uses `aria-pressed`.
- [x] Images have descriptive `alt` text.
- [x] Interactive components (Modal) have focus traps and management.
- [x] High-contrast color ratios (> 4.5:1).
- [x] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Next Steps

These findings should be addressed in Task 100: "Fix accessibility issues".
