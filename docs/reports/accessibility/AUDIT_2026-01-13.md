# Accessibility Audit Report (2026-01-13)

## Summary

A comprehensive accessibility audit was performed on the developer portfolio codebase, following up on the initial audit from 2026-01-12. The project maintains a very high standard of accessibility, with robust implementations of keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and ARIA patterns. All issues identified in the previous audit have been successfully resolved.

## Audit Findings

### 1. High Priority Issues

- **None.** Previous high-priority issues (Phantom Focus) have been resolved via `group-focus-within` visibility handling.

### 2. Medium Priority Issues

#### [ISSUE-005] Mobile Menu Focus Management

- **Location:** `src/components/common/Header.astro`
- **Description:** When the mobile menu is open, focus is not trapped within the menu. Keyboard users can potentially tab through elements in the background header.
- **Recommendation:** Implement a focus trap for the mobile menu when active, or apply `inert` to background elements.

#### [ISSUE-006] StatCounter Screen Reader Announcement

- **Location:** `src/components/sections/about/StatCounter.tsx`
- **Description:** The animated counter updates the DOM directly via `textContent`. Assistive technologies may only announce the initial value ("0") and miss the final count.
- **Recommendation:** Add `aria-live="polite"` to the value container or use a hidden static value that represents the final state.

### 3. Low Priority Issues

#### [ISSUE-007] Descriptive Alt Text

- **Location:** `src/components/sections/about/About.astro`
- **Description:** The avatar image uses the developer's name as alt text. While acceptable, it could be more descriptive.
- **Recommendation:** Update alt text to something like "Professional portrait of [Name]".

## Verification Checklist

- [x] **Skip Navigation:** Implemented and verified functional in `RootLayout.astro`.
- [x] **Semantic Landmarks:** Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` throughout the site.
- [x] **Focus Indicators:** High-visibility focus rings implemented globally via `:focus-visible` in `global.css`.
- [x] **Theme Switcher:** Fully accessible with `aria-pressed` and keyboard support.
- [x] **Modal Accessibility:** `ProjectModal.tsx` includes focus trapping, `aria-modal="true"`, and `Escape` key support.
- [x] **Reduced Motion:** Global support for `prefers-reduced-motion` media query in `global.css`.
- [x] **Form Accessibility:** `ContactForm.tsx` uses proper labeling, validation states, and ARIA descriptions.
- [x] **Language Support:** `lang="en"` correctly set on the document root.

## Final Assessment

The project is highly compliant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards. The remaining issues are minor and relate to fine-tuning the experience for specific assistive technologies.

## Next Steps

- Address remaining minor issues in subsequent testing/QA tasks (Tasks 132-134).
- Target 100/100 Accessibility score in final Lighthouse verification (Task 135).
