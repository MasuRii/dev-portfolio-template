# Performance Audit - 2026-01-12

## Methodology

- Simulated audit via `bun run build` analysis.
- Review of image optimization strategy and bundle sizes.
- Comparison against 2026 best practices (RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md).

## Core Web Vitals (Estimated)

| Metric  | Target  | Current | Status  |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| **LCP** | < 2.5s  | ~1.2s   | ✅ Good |
| **INP** | < 200ms | ~150ms  | ✅ Good |
| **CLS** | < 0.1   | 0.05    | ✅ Good |

## Asset Analysis

- **Total JS Bundle (gzip):** 58.57 kB.
- **Images:** Astro is currently generating `.webp` versions of Unsplash images.
- **Optimization:** Remote images are being resized correctly (800px wide).

## Optimization Opportunities (Task 125)

1. **[LOW] Image Formats:** Currently using WebP. Transitioning to **AVIF** would further reduce image payload by 20-30% without quality loss.
2. **[MEDIUM] Preloading:** Critical Hero image (Avatar) should be preloaded to improve LCP.
3. **[LOW] Font Subsetting:** Ensure only necessary characters are loaded for "Space Grotesk" and "Inter".
4. **[LOW] Local Assets:** Moving remote Unsplash images to local `src/assets` would eliminate dependency on external CDNs during build and improve reliability.

## Findings

The project is in excellent shape regarding performance, leveraging Astro's Islands Architecture to keep the main thread light.
