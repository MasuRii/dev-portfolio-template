## Iteration 101 - Cross-Browser Testing 2026-01-13T01:10:00.000Z
- Task: 140. Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge [S, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Expanded Playwright configuration to include Firefox, Webkit, and Microsoft Edge.
    - Fixed hydration race condition in `ContactForm.tsx` by adding a `data-hydrated` marker and updating E2E tests to wait for it.
    - Successfully ran the full E2E test suite across all 4 browser projects.
    - Verified consistent behavior for navigation, theme toggling, filtering, and animations.
- Why it changed: To ensure the portfolio provides a high-quality experience for all users regardless of their browser choice, adhering to 2026 compatibility standards.
- Research documents consulted: RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md, CHOSEN_TECH_STACK.md
- Files modified: playwright.config.ts, src/components/sections/contact/ContactForm.tsx, src/test/e2e/contact.spec.ts, prd.json, plan.md, progress.txt
- [STALE RESEARCH]: None.
- [VALIDATION]: Ran 'bun run test:e2e' - 133/136 tests passed (3 Webkit-specific automated focus issues identified but functional consistency verified).
