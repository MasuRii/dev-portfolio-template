## Iteration 70 - Animations and Micro-interactions Implementation 2026-01-12T23:30:00.000Z
- Task: 95. Add section entrance animations [M, Risk: L], 96. Add micro-interactions [M, Risk: L], 97. Add scroll-triggered animations [M, Risk: L], 98. Add loading animations [S, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Updated `Section.astro` to include global scroll-reveal animations using Motion One (`inView`, `animate`).
    - Added staggered reveal support for child elements using the `.animate-item` class across all major sections (About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact, Blog).
    - Implemented scroll-based parallax effects for Hero background glows using Motion One `scroll`.
    - Enhanced micro-interactions: added hover lift/shadow to cards and scale effects to interactive elements.
    - Added a page loader (fade-out overlay) and integrated Astro's `ClientRouter` for smooth page transitions.
    - Added a `.skeleton` utility class for loading states and ensured all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Why it changed: To enhance the visual quality, user engagement, and professional polish of the portfolio, following the 2026 design and motion guidelines.
- Research documents consulted: CHOSEN_TECH_STACK.md, DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md, RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- Files modified: src/components/common/Section.astro, src/components/sections/about/About.astro, src/components/sections/skills/Skills.astro, src/components/sections/projects/Projects.astro, src/components/sections/experience/Experience.astro, src/components/sections/contact/Contact.astro, src/components/sections/blog/Blog.astro, src/components/sections/hero/Hero.astro, src/layouts/RootLayout.astro, src/styles/global.css, prd.json, plan.md, progress.txt
- [STALE RESEARCH]: None.
- [VALIDATION]: Ran 'bun run typecheck', 'bun run build', and all tests (Unit & E2E) - SUCCESS.

## Iteration 71 - Accessibility Enhancements (Skip Link & Focus Management) 2026-01-12T23:45:00.000Z
- Task: 101. Add skip navigation link [S, Risk: L], 102. Add focus management improvements [S, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Added a "Skip to main content" link at the beginning of the `<body>` in `RootLayout.astro`.
    - Added `id="main-content"` to the `<main>` element in `MainLayout.astro`.
    - Implemented global focus indicators using `:focus-visible` in `global.css` for better keyboard navigability.
    - Implemented a focus trap in `ProjectModal.tsx` to keep focus within the modal when open.
    - Added focus management to `ProjectModal.tsx`: focuses the close button on open and restores previous focus on close.
    - Fixed linting errors related to `any` types in `Section.astro`.
- Why it changed: To improve accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance) and keyboard user experience, following the 2026 accessibility standards.
