## Iteration 70 - Animations and Micro-interactions Implementation 2026-01-12T23:30:00.000Z
- Task: 95. Add section entrance animations [M, Risk: L], 96. Add micro-interactions [M, Risk: L], 97. Add scroll-triggered animations [M, Risk: L], 98. Add loading animations [S, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Updated `Section.astro` to include global scroll-reveal animations using Motion One (`inView`, `animate`).
    - Added staggered reveal support for child elements using the `.animate-item` class across all major sections (About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact, Blog).
    - Implemented scroll-based parallax effects for Hero background glows using Motion One `scroll`.
    - Enhanced micro-interactions: added hover lift/shadow to cards and scale effects to interactive elements.
    - Added a page loader (fade-out overlay) and integrated Astro's `ClientRouter` for smooth page transitions.
    - Added a `.skeleton` utility class for loading states and ensured all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Why it changed: To enhance the visual quality, user engagement, and professional polish of the portfolio, following the 2026 design and motion guidelines.
- Research documents consulted: CHOSEN_TECH_STACK.md, DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md, RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- Files modified: src/components/common/Section.astro, src/components/sections/about/About.astro, src/components/sections/skills/Skills.astro, src/components/sections/projects/Projects.astro, src/components/sections/experience/Experience.astro, src/components/sections/contact/Contact.astro, src/components/sections/blog/Blog.astro, src/components/sections/hero/Hero.astro, src/layouts/RootLayout.astro, src/styles/global.css, prd.json, plan.md, progress.txt
- [STALE RESEARCH]: None.
- [VALIDATION]: Ran 'bun run typecheck', 'bun run build', and all tests (Unit & E2E) - SUCCESS.

## Iteration 71 - Accessibility Enhancements (Skip Link & Focus Management) 2026-01-12T23:45:00.000Z
- Task: 101. Add skip navigation link [S, Risk: L], 102. Add focus management improvements [S, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Added a "Skip to main content" link at the beginning of the `<body>` in `RootLayout.astro`.
    - Added `id="main-content"` to the `<main>` element in `MainLayout.astro`.
    - Implemented global focus indicators using `:focus-visible` in `global.css` for better keyboard navigability.
    - Implemented a focus trap in `ProjectModal.tsx` to keep focus within the modal when open.
    - Added focus management to `ProjectModal.tsx`: focuses the close button on open and restores previous focus on close.
    - Fixed linting errors related to `any` types in `Section.astro`.
- Why it changed: To improve accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance) and keyboard user experience, following the 2026 accessibility standards.
- Research documents consulted: CHOSEN_TECH_STACK.md, DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md, RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- Files modified: src/layouts/RootLayout.astro, src/layouts/MainLayout.astro, src/styles/global.css, src/components/sections/projects/ProjectModal.tsx, src/components/common/Section.astro, prd.json, plan.md, progress.txt
- [STALE RESEARCH]: None.
- [VALIDATION]: Ran 'bun run typecheck', 'bun run lint', and all tests - SUCCESS.

## Iteration 72 - Accessibility Audit 2026-01-12T23:55:00.000Z
- Task: 99. Run accessibility audit [S, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Performed manual accessibility audit across all major sections (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact, Blog).
    - Evaluated codebase against WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards.
    - Created a detailed audit report identifying 3 key issues: phantom focus in project cards, decorative SVGs in blog, and page loader semantics.
- Why it changed: To establish a baseline for accessibility compliance and identify areas for improvement as per the 2026 standards.
- Research documents consulted: RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md, DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md
- Files modified: docs/reports/accessibility/AUDIT_2026-01-12.md, prd.json, plan.md, progress.txt
- [STALE RESEARCH]: None.
- [VALIDATION]: Manual inspection performed.

## Iteration 73 - Accessibility Fixes (Audit Remediation) 2026-01-13T00:10:00.000Z
- Task: 100. Fix accessibility issues [M, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Resolved [ISSUE-001]: Fixed phantom focus in project cards by adding `group-focus-within:opacity-100` and `pointer-events-none` to overlays. This ensures keyboard users can see what they focus on while preventing accidental mouse clicks on invisible elements.
    - Resolved [ISSUE-002]: Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative SVGs in `Blog.astro`, `Skills.astro`, and `Header.astro`.
    - Resolved [ISSUE-003]: Added `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading page"` to the page loader in `RootLayout.astro`.
    - Verified all fixes with unit and E2E tests.
- Why it changed: To address findings from the accessibility audit and ensure WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance.
- Research documents consulted: docs/reports/accessibility/AUDIT_2026-01-12.md, DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md, RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- Files modified: src/components/sections/projects/ProjectCard.astro, src/components/sections/blog/Blog.astro, src/components/sections/skills/Skills.astro, src/components/common/Header.astro, src/layouts/RootLayout.astro, prd.json, plan.md, progress.txt
- [STALE RESEARCH]: None.
- [VALIDATION]: Ran 'bun run typecheck', 'bun run lint', and all tests (Unit & E2E) - SUCCESS.

## Iteration 74 - SEO Meta Tags Implementation 2026-01-13T00:25:00.000Z
- Task: 103. Add meta tags for SEO [S, Risk: L]
- What changed:
    - Updated `RootLayout.astro` to include comprehensive SEO meta tags: Primary Meta Tags (title, description, canonical), Open Graph (Facebook/LinkedIn), and Twitter Cards (X).
    - Implemented a default `ogImage` using a high-quality professional portrait placeholder sized for social sharing.
    - Enhanced `theme-color` meta tag to be dynamic: it now updates in real-time when the user toggles dark/light mode, using a new utility in `themeStore.ts` and an updated `ThemeScript.astro`.
    - Synchronized default title and description with `personal.json` data.
- Why it changed: To improve search engine visibility, social media shareability, and OS-level integration (theme-color) as per 2026 best practices.
- Research documents consulted: RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md, CHOSEN_TECH_STACK.md
- Files modified: src/layouts/RootLayout.astro, src/pages/index.astro, src/lib/themeStore.ts, src/components/common/ThemeScript.astro, prd.json, plan.md, progress.txt
- [STALE RESEARCH]: None.
- [VALIDATION]: Ran 'bun run typecheck' and all E2E tests - SUCCESS. Verified meta tags presence in head.
